## ðŸ“Š Stock Market Analysis & Prediction

### Technology Stocks: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META)

---

### Introduction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs a comprehensive analysis of the stock market performance of five major technology companies: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA), and Meta (META). The notebook explores their historical stock price data, visualizes trends, and develops a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model to predict the closing price of Apple (AAPL).

### Objectives

1.  **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:**
    * Download historical stock price data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library.
    * Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
    * Visualize the stock price trends for each company.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Calculate and visualize key statistical measures (e.g., moving averages, volatility).
    * Examine correlations between the stock prices of different companies.
    * Analyze trading volume and its impact on stock prices.

3.  **Feature Engineering:**
    * Create relevant features for the LSTM model, such as lagged closing prices, moving averages, and technical indicators.
    * Scale the data using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization.

4.  **LSTM Model Development:**
    * Build an LSTM neural network model to predict the closing price of Apple (AAPL).
    * Split the data into training and testing sets.
    * Train the LSTM model on the training data.
    * Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5.  **Visualization and Interpretation:**
    * Visualize the predicted vs. actual closing prices.
    * Analyze the model's performance and identify potential areas for improvement.
    * Discuss the implications of the findings and potential applications of the model.

### Methodology

1.  **Data Collection:** Stock data for AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, and META is fetched over a specified time period.
2.  **Data Cleaning:** Missing values are handled using appropriate methods (e.g., imputation or removal).
3.  **Data Visualization:** Line plots and other charts are used to visualize stock price trends and trading volumes.
4.  **Feature Engineering:** Lagged closing prices, moving averages, and other technical indicators are calculated.
5.  **Model Building:** An LSTM model is constructed using Keras, with appropriate layers and hyperparameters.
6.  **Model Training:** The model is trained on the training data, and its performance is monitored.
7.  **Model Evaluation:** The model's predictions are compared with the actual closing prices on the testing data.
8.  **Results and Discussion:** The findings are summarized, and potential improvements and applications are discussed.

### Expected Outcomes

* A clear understanding of the historical stock price trends for major tech companies.
* A predictive model for Apple's closing price using LSTM.
* Insights into the factors influencing stock prices.
* Visualizations and analysis that can be used for further research and investment decisions.
